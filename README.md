CodeIgniter + Modular Extensions + DataMapper
=============================================

This repository is only for start-up developing.

Put inside that the most libraries that I use for
my projects.

You can check the documentation of the libraries
included

* [datamapper](http://datamapper.wanwizard.eu/)
* [modular_extesions](https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc/wiki/Home)
* [template_library](http://maestric.com/doc/php/codeigniter_template)

Virtual Hosts
-------------

You can see that I'm using www **public folder**
instead putting index.php in the same level that
*application* and *system* folders.

To do that way, you'll need to change *index.php*
file and set the right path for these folders, ie:

	$system_path = '../system';

and

	$application_folder = '../application';

You'll need to change your Apache Virtual Hosts file
and your OS hosts file.

If you are using *UNIX based system, probably your
hosts file will be inside */etc/* folder.

	127.0.0.1	codeigniter.dev #Just an example

And your Apache's virtual hosts maybe look like this:

	NameVirtualHost *:80
	<Directory "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/codeigniter/www/">

	</Directory>
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	        ServerName "codeigniter.dev"
	        DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/codeigniter/www"
	</VirtualHost>
